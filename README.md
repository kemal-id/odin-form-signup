# odin-form-signup
Part of The Odin Project Portfolio project in JS Path, Intermediate HTML &amp; CSS lesson.

This is made with no responsive design in mind. Best viewed in desktop.
Why? Because the lesson description said I don't have to mind responsive design "for now".
Maybe in the future, I will redesign this with responsive desingn in mind.

Hope whoever sees this getting something out of my meager skills.
